# Cyclistic-case-study
This case study is part of Capstone Project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, an online course on Coursera. For this case study I am assigned as junior data analyst working in a marketing analyst team of a fictional company called 'Cyclystic'.

I used Mysql as a main tool for this analysis. This repository contains queries of:
- loading data
- cleaning data
- analyzing data
